Portfolio of data science projects completed for academic, self learning, and professional purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks and flask websites.

## Tools
  - **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn
  - **Data Analysis**: SQL, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Altair, Tableau
  

## Machine Learning
- [K-means Clustering - MoviRec](https://movirec.herokuapp.com/): Using K-means clustering and flask to predict what other movies you might like.
- [K-nearest neighbors Classification - NoShows](https://github.com/chasekregor/NoShows/blob/master/Final%20Notebook/KregorFinalNoShows.ipynb): Using a KNN and ensemble model to predict if patients will show up for their medical appointments.

    
## Data Analysis and Visualization
- [Exploratory Data Analysis - Strava Cycling Analysis 2019](https://github.com/chasekregor/StravaCyclingAnalysis2019): Simple analysis of my 2019 cycling data using statistics & visualizations to better understand my fitness. 
- [Exploratory Data Analysis - January 2019 Sleep Analysis](http://chasekregor.com/january-2019-sleep-analysis): Simple analysis of my January 2019 sleep data using statistics & visualizations to better understand my sleep hygiene.
- [Exploratory Data Analysis - Analyzing US Mass Shootings](https://github.com/chasekregor/AnalyzingUSMassShootings/blob/master/usmassshootings.ipynb): Simple analysis in order to have a better understanding of mass shootings in the US.


## End to End Data Science Projects
- [Flask Website - QuantChase](https://quantified-chase.herokuapp.com/week): Built and deployed a Flask website that aggregates & visualizes's my health data from various platforms.
- [Flask Website - MoviRec](https://movirec.herokuapp.com/): Using K-means clustering and flask to predict what other movies you might like.
